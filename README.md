# Hi there!
My names V3L0C1T13S, but you can just call me V3L0. I usually write programs that center around either reverse engineering, utility, or add onto an existing program.

Some projects I've worked on before include:

* [Reflectcord](https://github.com/V3L0C1T13S/reflectcord), a reimplementation of Discords backend on Revolt.chat using only their public facing API
* [Thunder Manager](https://github.com/V3L0C1T13S/thunder-manager), a tiny, fast, and sleek mod manager made primarily for the Thunder Store, but it can be adapted to any other store by manually specifying download URLs.
* [Rhythmbox Discord RPC](https://github.com/V3L0C1T13S/rhythmbox-discord-rpc), a Rhythmbox plugin that shows your friends what you're listening to, much like Discord's Spotify integration. Includes support for uploading album art, and is written entirely in C++ to avoid disrupting your listening experience with slowdowns.
